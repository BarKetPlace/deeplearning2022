    "# Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## DCGAN : Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling up Generative Adversarial Networks using Convolutional Neural Networks has always been quite difficult. Additionally, training of GANs is always difficult are require often several tips and tricks to obtain a desirable performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DCGAN is a specialised architecture that functions better by using some significant **architectural modifications** in implementing CNNs as compared to a normal CNN used in a supervised learning scenario [2]. Some of those modifications are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Using an 'All-Convolutional Net' architecture:* Typically, CNNs are constructed using Max-pool operations. However, in DCGANs this is replaced with the use of strided and fractionally strided convolutions. This is done so that the network can learn its own spatial downsampling or upsampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Eliminating fully connected layers at the top:* Does not use fully connected layers a the top of the convolutional features. Instead considers the reshaping of the latent data $\\mathbf{z}$ at the start of the generator network to reshaped into 4-dim tensor, and using a *flattening* operation at the end of the discriminator network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Using Batch-Normalization:* This normalizes the input to each unit to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps to deal with training problems. However, directly applying batch normalization to all layers results in sample oscillation and model instability. It shouldn't be applied on the generator output layer and on the discriminator input layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Using LeakyReLU as an activation fn.:* Typically ReLU activations are used in generator function, but using a 'Leaky' version (allowing some slope in the rectified region) proves to be better for higher resolution model. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Training of DCGANs\n",
    "\n",
    "The training will consist of simulatnaeous minibatch gradient descent using Adam for the Discriminator and Generator networks \n",
    "\n",
    "The training statistics that will be reported are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss_D** : The Discriminator loss that is computed over all real and all fake batches of data as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$log\\left(D\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)\\right) + log\\left(1 - D\\left(G\\left(\\mathbf{z}\\right)\\right)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for improved training it has been shown by Goodfellow et.al. that minimizing the Generator function using $log\\left(1 - D\\left(G\\left(\\mathbf{z}\\right)\\right)\\right)$ is not efficient in the initial stage, as early in the learning phase $D\\left(G\\left(\\mathbf{z}\\right)\\right)$ is usually close to 0 (since the generator is able to generate samples that look very far from the real), so the loss $log\\left(1 - D\\left(G\\left(\\mathbf{z}\\right)\\right)\\right)$ is close to zero, which means very less updates for the parameters of the $G\\left(\\mathbf{z}\\right)$ through backprop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead the function to be optimized could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$log\\left(D\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)\\right) + log\\left(D\\left(G\\left(\\mathbf{z}\\right)\\right)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**(which sadly is no longer a zero-sum game, but helps train the network better)** (for information on why this called a zero sum game, it is encouraged to consult the problem formulation in the tutorial [1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss_G** -  Generator loss calculated as $log\\left(D\\left(G\\left(\\mathbf{z}\\right)\\right)\\right)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**D(x), D(G(z))** -  Discriminator Outputs of real and fake samples respectively. Initally, these values will be far apart but will later become very close to 0.5 as G gets better. This will be illustrated graphically and explained analytically later on after training\n",
    "\n",
    "As a future reference, you can consult this repository for certain 'training hacks' concerning GANs: https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpolating latent space\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the DCGAN, you can examine the quality of the fake images by passing noise as inputs to the **trained** Generator network. Additionally, we can do something more interesting where we can try to see how a fake image of a digit say 1 changes to another digit 2. You will explore this by sampling two noise inputs $\\mathbf{z}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{z}_{2}$, interpolating them linearly using a parameter $\\rho$ and then looking at the resulting interpolated image by passing the interpolated noise input through the generator. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{z}_{interpolated} = \\rho \\mathbf{z}_{1} + (1 - \\rho) \\mathbf{z}_{2}, \\hspace{0.5 in} \\rho \\in \\left[0, 1\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{x}_{interpolated} = G\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{interpolated}\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will implement a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) model on the MNIST dataset and learn to generate real and fake images (using PyTorch). \n",
    "\n",
