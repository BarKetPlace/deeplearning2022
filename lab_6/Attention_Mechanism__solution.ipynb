    "# Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore the use of attention mechanisms to solve a machine translation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is (1) to understand the structure of a sequence-to-sequence model and (2) to identify where and how the attention mechanism intervene in the model archicture.\n",
    "This tutorial is also an occasion to practice the use of recurrent neural network in a context that is different from a classification or a regression task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### seq2seq\n",
    "The model we will use is a sequence-to-sequence model (see picture below) which is the state of the art for a machine translation task, i.e. a model that should learn to transform a sequence of word in language A into a sequence of words into another language B. In the litterature these models are also refered to as `Transformers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward pass through a seq2seq model is a two stage process:\n",
    "1. The input sequence is fed to an `Encoder` model. The role of the `encoder` is to learn a representation of the input sequence that is useful to the second stage.\n",
    "2. The representation of the input sequence is fed to a `Decoder` model. The role of the `decoder` is to use the representation learned by the encoder to produce the desired output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The representation is often called a latent representation or a hidden representation. That is because it is only manipulated internally by the Encoder-Decoder model.\n",
    "Because the inputs and outputs are sequences, the latent representation is also a sequence.\n",

    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks for this lab are to:\n",
    "- Finish the implementation of the Bahdanau attention weights computation\n",
    "- Finish the implementation of the training function\n",
    "- Edit the forward function of the decoder to output the attention weights\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use English to German sentence pairs obtained from the Tatoeba Project.\n",
    "The compiled sentence pairs can be found [here](https://www.manythings.org/anki/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supplementary\n",
    "- To improve the training performance, and potentially the test performance, you can implement a batch data loader for the training dataset and testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  References\n",
    "\n",
    "- An introduction to recurrent neural networks is available [here](https://blog.floydhub.com/a-beginners-guide-on-recurrent-neural-networks-with-pytorch/)\n",
    "- The attention mechanism were first introduced in the article by Dzmitry Bahdanau et al. available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473).\n",

    "As you can see in the figure above, in the encoder part of the model (the green boxes), one hidden state is produced for each time sample that is fed to the encoder model. The produced hidden state is then used together with the next input time sample to produce the next hidden state and so on until the last input time sample has been fed to the encoder.\n",

    "From the example above, we can see that for each output word from the decoder, the weights assigned to the input words are different and we can see the relationship between the inputs and outputs that the model is able to draw. You can try this on a few more examples to test the results of the translator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our training, we have clearly overfitted our model to the training sentences. If we were to test the trained model on sentences it has never seen before, it is unlikely to produce decent results. Nevertheless this process acts as a sanity check to ensure that our model works and is able to function end-to-end and learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of training an effective model can be attributed largely to the lack of training data and training time. Due to the complex nature of the different languages involved and large number of vocabulary and grammatical permutations, an effective model will require tons of data and training time before any results can be seen on evaluation data.\n"
